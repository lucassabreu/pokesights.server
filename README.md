# PokeSights Server

A simple server wrote on NodeJS and with MongoDB as database to collect and retrive data about Pokemons location, the API clients would provide send pokemon's sights to the API and confirm or negate others users sights.

That data could be used to identify "Pokemon Nests" based on the number of sights and unsights in a point.
